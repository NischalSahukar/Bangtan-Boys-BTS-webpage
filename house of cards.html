<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Outro: House of Cards</h1>
<p>"Outro: House of Cards" is a song by Jungkook, Jimin, Jin and V (also known as the vocal-line) of BTS. It was released on November 30, 2015, and appears as the ninth track for their fourth mini album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.2. A full length edition was released on May 2, 2016 and serves as the fifth track of the CD 2 in their first compilation album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever.<br>
The song has some seriously meaningfull summary about relationships. A relationship can be between anyone and anything, its not only about two lovers or couples.This song by the BTS Vocal line explains us the true meaning of a relationship in life. They are comparing it with a house which is made of cards. House of card is basically a structure built out of playing cards precariously balanced together. (like buildings we used to make during our childhood.) It needs a lot of patience, trust, time and thoughts before builiding it. In the end if we give our best it stands tall and successful. The same thing happens in a relationship, it takes time to build good understanding, trust and believe between each other, Patience, care, love, time everything is needed for a happy relationship. It can be between anyone, between two lovers, two friends, parents, step-mother or father or sibling, anyone.This was the main significance of the lyrics. BTS is telling us basically that our relationship with them took a lot of time, love , patience and many more and the final outcome was that we are armies.</p>
