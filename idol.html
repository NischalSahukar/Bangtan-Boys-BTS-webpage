<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - IDOL</h1>
<p>"Idol" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BTS. It was released on August 24, 2018, by Big Hit Entertainment as the lead single from the band's third compilation album Love Yourself: Answer (2018). An alternative version of the song featuring Nicki Minaj was included as a bonus track on the digital version of the album. The single debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the two versions combined sold 43,000 downloads in their first week of sale in the US. It is certified platinum by the RIAA.On July 3, 2019, the Japanese version of the song was released as a B-side track.<br>
By combining traditional Korean musical elements, including janggu with modern hip-hop groove, the group blends modern and traditional Korean music instruments into one rather than pure pop music, creating a refreshing and surprising beat.<br>
As described by Billboard's Tamar Herman, "Idol" is a "traditionally inspired track" featuring different classical Korean instruments. According to media outlets, the song and the music video were inspired by Korean genre pansori and John Woo's 1997 movie Face/Off. Yonhap reported, "The song is electronic dance music in the style of South African dance music. The African beats are layered with traditional Korean rhythms, as well as the pounding of a Korean folk percussion instrument used in the performance of traditional Korean farmers' ensemble. Rolling Stone India said, "According to the group's label Big Hit Entertainment, “Idol” was inspired by gqom, a style of house music that originated in Durban, South Africa. Gqom combines powerful traditional thumping drum with bass and house synths in a balance between tradition and trend." adding, "The track's blend of Korean instruments like the gakgung (the Korean horn-bow which explains the shehnai-like sounds) with African rhythms, trap rap and electronica contribute to expanding its culturally rich, diverse, global sound".<br>
"Idol" is in the key of C# minor and incorporates various styles such as pop, world, contemporary R&B, and K-pop. Both versions are 126 beats per minute. One of the writers, Ali Tamposi, stated the rep from Big Hit wanted the song to feel intense.<br>
In 2020, the lyrics of "Idol" were displayed in a special exhibition titled "Korean Pop Lyrics: Melodies of Life" at the National Hangeul Museum in Seoul.<br>
The music video for "Idol" was preceded by a teaser clip released two days prior, with the full video premiering on YouTube on August 24, 2018. It became the most watched music video within the first 24 hours on the platform, garnering 45.9 million views within that time and surpassing Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do", which recorded 43.2 million views in 2017. It also became the most viewed music video by a K-pop group in the first 24 hours, breaking the record previously held by Blackpink's "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", which earned 32.6 million views in its first 24 hours. "Idol" surpassed 100 million views on August 29 and became the fastest music video in YouTube history to reach the milestone—Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" broke the record the following December when it reached the mark four days after release. In September 2022, the music video became BTS' sixth to surpass 1 billion views.
A music video for the remix of the single featuring Nicki Minaj was released on September 6, 2018. Mostly identical to the original music video, it includes additional scenes of Minaj rapping her part while a Korean transliteration of the lyrics appears onscreen behind her.<br></p>
