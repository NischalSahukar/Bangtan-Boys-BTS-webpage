<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Heartbeat</h1>
<p>"Heartbeat" is a song by South Korean boy band BTS, released on June 28, 2019, as the fourth and main single from and in tandem with the album BTS World: Original Soundtrack. A music video was released alongside the song.<br>The song is described as having a "pop-rock melody" featuring the group's "dulcet vocals" as well as lyrics about destiny, which were also called a "love letter" to the group's fans. The song was revealed in the game prior to the soundtrack's release, but players had to first reach mission 14 of the first chapter to listen to it.<br>
The music video was also released on June 28, featuring "fantasy-meets-reality visuals which sees all seven members on their own journeys". It has been described as intermedial and self-reflexive.<br>
Heartbeat is one of the most soothing song ever heard from BTS. It deserves to be the title track among all OSTs of BTS World.Generally, Heartbeat is a view of destiny. Destiny of BTS before, today and tomorrow. Destiny of ARMY before, today and tomorrow. The song's lyrics will be divided into two parts. The first part of this song [from intro to verse 2] mainly captures the feeling of longing to someone or something that eventually will change our life. The members are expressing their thoughts and memories about their hard time in their early debut. Then, they express the love for ARMYs who then become the strength for them until today.<br>
And then, the thing differs in the second part [verse 3 to post- chorus] , where the destiny or path is already found and it’s about time to follow where the destiny brings you. And there’s a very important message at the end of song.BTS is emphasizing the presence and impact that ARMY has to them. Again, they are blessed to have ARMY and wish ARMY to believe in them<br>
<b>Feel destiny in me me me me me</b><br>
BTS ask ARMY to believe in today’s destiny that brought BTS and ARMY together. Keep believing this destiny as we complete each other.</p>

<pre>[Intro: V, Jungkook]
It leaves me feeling seasick, baby
Kkum gateun hyeonshil gi-piga juna-bwa
It spins me 'round and drives me crazy

[Verse 2: RM]
When you hear my heartbeat baby
You give me a new life you give me a new birth
I feel you're a heartbeat away
I've been losing my mind I've been cravin' my shine
I know me before you was a ready-made me
But you designate me and you resume me
I'd be calling your name in this universe
(Now I need no space)
I got youniverse, done

[Verse 3: J-Hope, Suga]
