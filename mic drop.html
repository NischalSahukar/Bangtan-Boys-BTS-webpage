<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Mic Drop</h1>
<p>"Mic Drop" (stylized as "MIC Drop") is a song recorded in two languages (Korean and Japanese) by South Korean boy band BTS. The Korean version was originally included as a B-side track on the band's fifth extended play, Love Yourself: Her (2017), and later remixed by American producer and DJ Steve Aoki. The remix was released as the second single from the EP on November 24, 2017 by Big Hit Entertainment and features a guest appearance by American rapper Desiigner. It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on December 5, 2017, as a single in that country. The Japanese-language version of "Mic Drop" was released on December 6, 2017 by Def Jam Recordings and Virgin Music as a triple A-side single album that included "DNA" and a new, original song "Crystal Snow", both also in Japanese. Both the Korean and Japanese versions of the song were written by Supreme Boi, "Hitman" Bang, J-Hope, RM, and Pdogg, with the latter of the five solely handling production. The remix version was also written by the same songwriters, with additional songwriting by Aoki, Desiigner, Tayla Parx, Flowsik, and Shae Jacobs. It was produced by Aoki, with Pdogg providing additional production. A hip hop song, the lyrics celebrate BTS' numerous achievements.<br>
The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who praised its beat, sound, and musical styles, and picked it as a standout track, on Love Yourself: Her. Commercially, the remix version of "Mic Drop" debuted at number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's first track to reach the top 40 on the chart. The song appeared at number 37 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 46 on the UK Singles Chart, in addition to reaching moderate peaks in several other territories. The Japanese version debuted at number one on both the Oricon Singles Chart and the Billboard Japan Hot 100. It was the 13th best-selling single of 2017 in Japan. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).<br>
Two music videos were filmed for "Mic Drop", one for the Korean remix version and one for the Japanese version. Woogie Kim directed the music video for the Korean version which premiered on Big Hit's YouTube channel at the same time as the song's release. The video for the Japanese version was uploaded to Universal Music Japan's YouTube channel on December 5, 2017. Both videos depict the band performing powerful choreography in various settings. Following the release of Love Yourself: Her, BTS appeared on several South Korean music programs including M! Countdown, Music Bank, and Inkigayo. They promoted the remix version of the song with performances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Saturday Night Live, amongst others. It was also included on the setlist for the band's Love Yourself World Tour (2018–19).<br>
South Korean boy band BTS had achieved consecutive entries on Billboard charts with The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016). The band further garnered major attention in the United States after winning the Top Social Artist award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, becoming the first K-pop group ever to be nominated for and win a Billboard Music Award. They released their fifth extended play Love Yourself: Her on September 18, 2017 to commercial success. The EP debuted and peaked at number seven on the US Billboard 200, becoming the first Korean album to enter the top 10 on the chart. Originally included as a B-side track on Love Yourself: Her, a remix of "Mic Drop" by electro house DJ Steve Aoki featuring American rapper Desiigner, was announced for release as a single on November 7, 2017. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Desiigner stated that he had met the band at the Billboard Music Awards earlier that year and became involved in the collaboration.<br>
"Mic Drop" was released for digital download and streaming in various countries by Big Hit Entertainment on November 24, 2017, as the second single from Love Yourself: Her. Big Hit and RED Music later serviced the song to contemporary hit radio in the US on December 5, 2017. An extended version of the remix appears on the band's third compilation album Love Yourself: Answer (2018). A Japanese version of the song was digitally released for purchase on December 6, 2017 by Universal Music Japan as the band's eighth Japanese-language single album, together with the Japanese version of previously released Korean single "DNA" and a new, original Japanese track "Crystal Snow". It was also released as a four-version CD single in Japan on the same day, with a regular edition and three different limited editions: A, B and C. All four editions contain "Mic Drop", "DNA" and "Crystal Snow" as a triple A-side. Individually, edition A includes a DVD with the music video for the Japanese version of "Mic Drop" and a dance version video of the song, edition B comes with a DVD that contains behind the scenes footage of the music video for "Mic Drop" and the making of album jacket photos, and edition C contains a 36-page photobook. The Japanese version was later included on the band's third Japanese-language studio album Face Yourself (2018).<br>
Musically, the album version of "Mic Drop" has been described as a groovy hip hop number backed by heavy bass and sampled gunshots. The remix version introduces EDM synths and trap-infused beats over the original hip hop melody. In terms of musical notation, the original version was composed in the key of F♯ major, while the remix was composed in A♯ minor. Both versions have a tempo of 170 beats per minute and last for 3:58. Two versions of the remix were released: the studio version released on digital streaming platforms featured Desiigner, while the version accompanying the music video replaced the rapper's intro with Korean verses from the original album version. Both the original Korean and Japanese versions were written by Pdogg, Supreme Boi, "Hitman" Bang, and band members J-Hope and RM, with production handled solely by Pdogg. The remixed version was also created by the same songwriters, with additional writing by Aoki, Desiigner, Tayla Parx, Flowsik, and Shae Jacobs.</p>
