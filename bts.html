<a id="introduction"><h2><font color= #BF40BF> Introduction </font></h2></a>
<p align: "justify">BTS stands for "BangTan Sonyeondan", which means "BulletProof Boy Scouts or Bangtan Boys" in Korean. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond The Scene" which adds extended meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a boy to an adult who opens the doors that are facing forward". They made their debut on June 13th 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment where the eldest age was 22 years and the maknae was just 17 years old. The group contains seven members: Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, Jungkook who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p> 
<p align: "justify">BTS debuted with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles (in 1966‚Äì1968) to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.</p>
<p align: "justify">As of 2023, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history according to the Circle Chart, having sold in excess of 40 million albums. Their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and five million registered sales. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour, 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021. The group's accolades include multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for five Grammy Awards. Outside of music, they have addressed three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and partnered with UNICEF in 2017 to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign. Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and dubbed the "Princes of Pop", BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017‚Äì2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of the South Korean Order of Cultural Merit for their contributions in spreading the Korean culture and language.<br>
On June 14, 2022, the group announced a scheduled pause in group activities to enable the members to complete their mandatory South Korean military service, with a reunion planned for 2025. Jin, the oldest member, became the first to enlist, on December 13, 2022, with J-Hope enlisting on April 18, 2023</p>

<p>V, whose full name is Kim Taehyung, was the one who said <font color= #8A2BE2>"Borahae"</font> during BTS‚Äô third muster. It was the BTS annual fan meeting held back in November of 2016. The moment when purple light sparkled the audience, V explained what does I purple you mean.<br>
‚ÄúDo you know what does color purple means? Purple is the last color of the rainbow colors, so it means I will trust and love you for a long time,‚Äù
Other BTS members and ARMY were so impressed. V knew this, but then he admitted that he was just kidding.
‚ÄúI just made it up,‚Äù<br>
Yet, he continued talking about the significance behind the color and it related to his love for fans. V said. ‚ÄúI wish I can see you for a long time, just like the Borahae means. We‚Äôll always trust you and go up the stairs with you,‚Äù</p></div><figure1>
<img src = "C:\Users\nisch\Downloads\army-ocean-bts.gif" width = "350" height = "200">
</figure1>
<p>Since then, Army welcomed purple as BTS‚Äô color, and their way of telling BTS how much they love them. It became BTS purple. From that point, it is just BTS color unofficially. Just like the army, BTS also uses this phrase to show their love for ARMY. BTS army always hears BTS members saying the line during their ending speeches at their concerts or during their award show speeches. Every time they say it, the army knows BTS is thanking them for their support and love. Purple is not just a colour, but a representation of love between BTS and ARMY members.
'I will trust and love you for a long time. 'The purple ocean is a symbol of the bond shared between BTS and ARMY. </p>
<p>NEW YORK, 24 September 2018 -  BTS joined United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres; President of Rwanda Paul Kagame; World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, European Union, Ms. Federica Mogherini; UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore; United Nations Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth Jayathma Wickramanayake; Unilever CEO Paul Polman; and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Lilly Singh, among other global, business, education and youth leaders to launch a new partnership to get every young person into quality education, training or employment by 2030, at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly. Generation Unlimited will tackle the global education and training crisis currently holding back millions of young people and threatening progress and stability by focusing on three key areas of work: secondary-age education; skills for learning, employability and decent work; and empowerment.</p>

<p><b>As prepared for delivery</b><br>
"Thank you, Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF Executive Director, Excellencies and distinguished guests from across the world.<br>
"My name is Kim Nam Jun, also known as RM, the leader of the group BTS. It‚Äôs an incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today‚Äôs young generation.<br>
"Last November, BTS launched the ‚ÄúLove Myself‚Äù campaign with UNICEF, building on our belief that ‚Äútrue love first begins with loving myself.‚Äù  We have been partnering with UNICEF‚Äôs #ENDviolence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence.<br>
"Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm.  We truly have the best fans in the world!<br>
"I would like to begin by talking about myself.<br>
"I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea.  It‚Äôs a beautiful place, with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy.<br>
"I would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero, saving the world.<br>
"In an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says, ‚ÄúMy heart stopped‚Ä¶I was maybe nine or ten.‚Äù<br>
"Looking back, that‚Äôs when I began to worry about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the stars at night. I stopped daydreaming. I tried to jam myself into moulds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others.  No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.<br>
"I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice in me that said, ‚ÄòWake up, man, and listen to yourself!‚Äù But it took me a long time to hear music calling my name.
"Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were hurdles. Most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes, I just wanted to quit<br>
"I think I was very lucky that I didn‚Äôt give it all up.<br>
"I‚Äôm sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling. We have become artists performing in huge stadiums and selling millions of albums.<br>
"But I am still an ordinary, twenty-four-year-old guy. If there‚Äôs anything that I‚Äôve achieved, it was only possible because I had my other BTS members by my side, and because of the love and support of our ARMY fans.<br>
"Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday‚Äôs me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that‚Äôs me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become. <br>
"I would like to say one last thing.<br>
"After releasing the ‚ÄúLove Yourself‚Äù albums and launching the ‚ÄúLove Myself‚Äù campaign,  we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world,  how our messagehelped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. These stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.<br>
"So, let‚Äôs all take one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to ‚Äúspeak yourself.‚Äù<br>
"I would like to ask all of you. What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat?<br>
"Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you‚Äôre from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself.<br>
"Find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself.<br>
"I‚Äôm Kim Nam Jun, RM of BTS.<br>
"I‚Äôm a hip-hop idol and an artist from a small town in Korea.<br>
"Like most people, I made many mistakes in my life.<br>
"I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I‚Äôm starting to love myself, little by little.<br>
"What is your name? Speak Yourself!"</p></div>

 Here‚Äôs the order that BTS‚Äôs members joined the company, and their reasons for joining BigHit Entertainment in the first place. Hopefully some of their stories will inspire you!
<h3>First: RM</h3>
RM, whose full name is Kim Namjoon, was the first member of BTS and is the band‚Äôs leader. RM, whose previous stage name was Rap Monster, is one of the band‚Äôs rappers. He started rapping in the sixth grade after he listened to Epik High‚Äôs ‚ÄúFly‚Äù for the first time. In 2007, when he was in middle school, RM started rapping under the name Runch Randa, which led him to the rap crew Daenamhyup. (The crew also consisted of now-known stars like Top Dogg‚Äôs KIDOH, Big Hit Entertainment producer Supreme Boi and Show Me the Money 3 finalist Iron.) After that, RM started releasing more songs as a solo rapper until he was invited to audition for a hip-hop agency, where he met Untouchable‚Äôs Sleepy, who was a judge at the audition. Impressed by RM‚Äôs rapping, Sleepy connected RM to producer Bang Shi Hyuk, who invited him to audition for Big Hit Entertainment. Then, in 2010, RM became one of BTS band members, and the rest is history.
<h3>Second: Suga</h3>
Suga, whose real name is Min Yoongi, started as a rapper under the name Gloss in high school. It didn‚Äôt take long for Suga to make a name for himself as both a rapper and a producer. (He was known at the time for producing and composing beats for local artists, like band D-Town, in his hometown of Daegu.) Soon after, Suga started producing tracks for more well-known artists, like Reflow, who worked with Suga on his song ‚ÄúWho Am I.‚Äù Suga auditioned for Big Hit Entertainment after he saw a flyer for the company‚Äôs rap competition called ‚ÄúHit It.‚Äù Suga didn‚Äôt win the competition, but he did take second place, which was enough for Big Hit Entertainment to sign him as a producer and a trainee. Though he planned on only becoming a producer, Suga was convinced to join BTS in 2010 and became one of the band‚Äôs rappers. (He‚Äôs joked that founder Bang Shi Hyuk ‚Äútricked‚Äù him into becoming a BTS member.)
<h3>Third: J-Hope</h3>
Before BTS, J-Hope, whose full name is Jung Hoseok, was best known as a dancer. He started in the dance crew Neuron in his hometown of Gwangju before he auditioned for JYP Entertainment. Though he made it through a few rounds, J-Hope was eventually cut from JYP, which led him to audition for Big Hit Entertainment instead. Because of his dance skills and his sense of rhythm, Big Hit Entertainment saw J-Hope‚Äôs potential was a rapper and signed him as a trainee. However, J-Hope‚Äôs debut as one of BTS members almost didn‚Äôt happen. While he was a trainee, J-Hope and Big Hit Entertainment almost parted ways until RM convinced them both that BTS needed a member like J-Hope. After that, J-Hope stayed with the band and became one of BTS‚Äôs three rappers, alongside RM and Suga. And so that‚Äôs how all of BTS members were discovered.
<h3>Fourth: Jin</h3>
Jin, whose full name is Kim Seokjin, was the fourth member of BTS. Jin was originally scouted by SM Entertainment while on the street of his hometown in Anyang. But, thinking that the offer was a scam, he never followed up with the company. He was scouted again‚Äîthis time by Big Hit Entertainment‚Äîwhile as a college student. A scout for Big Hit Entertainment saw Jin as he was leaving a bus and convinced him to audition for the company. As a theatre major with no singing or dancing experience, Jin auditioned to be an actor. However, Big Hit Entertainment had other plans and convinced him to become a trainee for BTS. He is now one of the band‚Äôs vocalists. Though Jin never planned to become a K-pop idol, we can‚Äôt imagine him as anything else other than one of BTS members.

<h3>Fifth: Jungkook</h3>
Jungkook, whose full name is Jeon Jeongguk, is one of BTS‚Äô singers. He‚Äôs also the youngest member of the band, making him BTS‚Äô Golden Maknae. Jungkook, whose nickname is Kookie, was discovered when he auditioned for the third season of Superstar K in his hometown of Busan. He was eliminated in the audition round, but the show gave him enough exposure to be scouted by at least seven agencies, including JYP Entertainment, FNC Entertainment and Starship Entertainment. In the end, though, Jungkook chose Big Hit Entertainment to become a trainee at. Jungkook has said that the reason he chose Big Hit Entertainment over the other agencies was because of RM, who impressed him with his rapping, which made Jungkook want to train and work with him. Long story short, RM is one of the reasons that Jungkook is one of BTS members.
<h3>Sixth: V</h3>
V, whose full name is Kim Taehyung, is the son of farmers in Daegu. With a dream of becoming a musician, V started playing the saxophone in high school, at the recommendation of his father. Soon after, he accompanied a friend to an audition for Big Hit Entertainment in Daegu. V didn‚Äôt intend to audition himself and was only there to support his friend, but a team member at Big Entertainment saw him and encouraged him to audition. After he called his father for permission, V auditioned on the spot and became the only person from Daegu that day to make it to the next round. He eventually became one of BTS members and is one of the band‚Äôs vocalists.
<h3>Seventh: Jimin</h3>
Jimin, whose full name is Park Jimin, was the final member of BTS. While as a student at the Busan High School of Arts, where he studied under the Department of Dance, a dance teacher, impressed by Jimin‚Äôs talent, encouraged him to audition for Big Hit Entertainment. After he passed the audition in his hometown in Busan, Jimin was flown to Seoul, where he became a trainee. As the last member, Jimin‚Äôs training was the shortest in the band. He debuted with the rest of BTS members in 2013.
<a id="bonding"><h2><font color= #BF40BF>BTS members bonding with each other</font></h2></a>
<p>Lately, there‚Äôs been some turbulence in the BTS fandom, as the members prepare themselves to fulfill their military duties. This means that until 2025, the seven bandmates will have to put most of their group activities on hold, and focus instead on their individual projects while taking turns enlisting. As the band said numerous times, there‚Äôs no cause for concern, though. BTS will perform as seven again in the future, and the bonds between the members are strong enough to remain intact until then.<br>
In this way, BTS seems to defy expectations, having built an incredibly steady partnership through years of working and living together. Usually, bands end up falling apart after a few years, with members following their own paths and airing out their dirty laundry in the process. This does not seem likely with BTS. The bandmates have always been upfront about the most difficult periods in their lives, admitting to fighting a lot during the band‚Äôs earlier years, and even confessing an almost-disbandment in 2018.<br>
Above all, the BTS members seem to hold great respect for each other, and over the years have built a solid foundation upon which their friendships stand. In addition to the good music, ARMYs have immense appreciation for the dynamics within the group, which they swear is one of the key components to BTS‚Äô success.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>RM‚Äôs group photo in his studio</li>
Group leader RM held a V Live broadcast at his studio, and what grabbed fans‚Äô attention was a framed group photo of BTS on his desk. The photo, taken on the day of shooting for the group‚Äôs fan meeting ‚Äú3RD Muster‚Äù in 2016, featured the seven members posing and smiling in comfortable outfits. RM had previously said the photo was one of his most treasured belongings. During the broadcast, the BTS rapper talked about his relationship with his bandmates and how they embrace each other‚Äôs differences. ‚ÄúAbout our group, I think it‚Äôs like sailing on the same ship while looking at different directions. And while working as a team, we‚Äôve achieved things that we‚Äôd never dreamed of in the name of BTS while keep seeing each other‚Äôs most ideal sides,‚Äù he said.<br>
‚ÄúAnd I think our members are also aware of that, even better than me. It‚Äôs a miracle that we‚Äôve come this far,‚Äù he added.
<li><h3>Jungkook‚Äôs leg injury during London leg of world tour</li>
In October 2018, Jungkook injured his foot ahead of the London gig of the act‚Äôs European world tour. He took part in the performance by sitting on a movable stool throughout the set while his bandmates performed dance moves.
The heartbreaking moment, however, changed into a heartwarming one as other members wheeled him around during the performances, and kept him company so he wouldn‚Äôt feel isolated. The bandmates took turns cheering him up and making him laugh.<br>
During the performance of ‚ÄúAnpanman,‚Äù Jungkook became overwhelmed with emotions and began to cry. While he wiped away tears, Jimin and V came over to comfort their crying bandmate. Fans also cheered him on, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right‚Äù in Korean. He responded by saying, ‚ÄúThank you, I love you.‚Äù The London leg of BTS‚Äô world tour definitely showed the act‚Äôs family-like bonds.
<li><h3>‚ÄòBurn the Stage‚Äô conflict between V and Jin</li>
Friendship inevitably entails small and big conflicts, and BTS members are no exception. But what really defines a good relationship is the way people resolve issues. The fourth episode of the act‚Äôs YouTube Red series ‚ÄúBTS: Burn the Stage,‚Äù released in April, featured BTS members having a conversation about the stage setting prior to the act‚Äôs New York performance. During the discussion, tension rose as V and Jin started to clash over their stage positions. Things got emotional when V criticized Jin‚Äôs routine and the latter voiced a different opinion.<br>
As group leader, RM admonished the two by telling them not to act like amateurs. After finishing the performance, the seven bandmates once again gathered to talk about the conflict and bury the hatchet. Suga said, ‚ÄúYou two must feel sorry, although you guys are not talking to each other. Now that we are touring around the world, the current depth of our bonds must have changed a lot since out debut. We got much closer and got to understand each other better.‚Äù
RM said, ‚ÄúOf course there are circumstances that make us angry, and all of us have some twisted sides and make mistakes, including myself. And sometimes, such parts of us develop into clashes when it comes to performances. But I think we should now learn how to step back for each other. It‚Äôs not about winning or losing. It‚Äôs about yielding for the team.‚Äù Later in an individual interview, Jimin said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs really amazing is that no matter how serious our fight is, we eventually sit down to talk about it. We don‚Äôt just let the emotions fester. Although we might not understand each other at first, we always talk about it a day later, seek a solution and then just trust each other.‚Äù
<li><h3>V & Jimin dumpling incident</li>
‚ÄúAt one point, I had a bad shot. The hyungs I was acting with taught me a lot, but I couldn't pull it off. I thought I completely ruined one scene where I had to show emotion. And I was worried that because of that, I might hear, 'Bangtan's acting sucks'. This was the first time a BTS member was acting on-screen and if I messed it up, people might look down on us,‚Äù Kim Taehyung said. "So I told myself, 'I'll do my best,' but when I messed up that shot, no one said anything bad, but I already felt that way in my own head. I was really depressed. I'm sure the other members were really frustrated. They told me to talk to them if things were rough, but I didn't tell them anything. It's the way I am, I'm not good at talking about those things. I can't work up the courage," he added. This was the backdrop of the dumpling incident, as described in the book "BEYOND THE STORY: 10-YEAR RECORD OF BTS". ‚ÄúI finished the drama shoot and had to come right back to prep for the album ... but I was so hungry. I hadn't had a chance to eat. So I asked the manager to order some dumplings, and I was eating during choreography practice. But Jimin didn't know my situation, so he said we should eat after practice, and we had a squabble," V said. They did talk about the incident on a few occasions before they shared the details of it during a subunit video as part of the FESTA celebrations, in June 2020. The singers revealed that they fought over when they should eat. While V wanted to eat dumplings in between the practise, Jimin suggested that they eat once they're done since the members too hadn't eaten at that point. "We didn't talk for two weeks. 
<li><h3>BTS members and their friendship tattoos</li>
During the BTS Festa 2022 dinner in June, members of the K-pop superband discussed about getting a similar friendship tattoo as they revealed that they are gearing up to focus more on their 'solo' careers. They talked about getting a small tattoo that would be a sign of their decade-long friendship and close bond with each other. Since Jimin and Jungkook were the only ones who had tattoos till then, they suggested getting the number '7' inked. Now, all the members have got the number tattooed on different parts of their bodies.
<li><h3>During their reality show Bon Voyage, the BTS members wrote letters to express their love and respect for one another.</li>
<p>‚ÄúI felt that I had a lot to learn from you.‚Äù<br>
In his letter, Suga told his ‚Äúeternal roommate‚Äù, Jin, how proud he is of Jin‚Äôs perseverance. For years, Suga watched Jin struggle to become a better singer and dancer. Suga tells Jin that his unrelenting dedication has paid off, and that it was touching to see Jin work hard to strengthen his areas of weakness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome and be embraced in my big heart.‚Äù<br>
In his letter, BTS‚Äôs oldest member, Jin, calls BTS‚Äôs multi-talented maknae the ‚Äúteacher and energy of the team‚Äù. Jin tells Jungkook that he appreciates everything Jungkook does, and thanks him for having the same ‚Äúmental age‚Äù as him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough I‚Äôm inspired by all the members, I‚Äôm especially inspired by you.‚Äù<br>
In his letter, Jungkook tells RM how much he inspires him by setting a good example. Jungkook has many things he‚Äôd like to learn but has trouble sticking to them. He says that whenever he sees RM working on music, talking about music, or speaking English, it inspires Jungkook to feel more confident and passionate about his own goals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter such 6 years, you‚Äôre now my dearest friend.‚Äù<br>
In his letter to Jimin, V reminisces about their trainee days. For years they ate, studied, and practiced together. He tells Jimin that Jimin was the only one who laughed and cried with him, and how thankful he is to have debuted with such a good friend. V thanks Jimin for still being there for him when he cries, and hopes that they will have many more years together.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have shown everyone that your strangeness is actually your unique charm.‚Äù<br>
In RM‚Äôs poetic letter to V, he confesses that he didn‚Äôt know what to make of V, at first. V‚Äôs oddities puzzled RM, but over time he started to understand why V could make friends so easily: his strangeness was his charm. RM thanks V for choosing to become a singer, rather than a farmer or saxophonist.</p>
<p>‚ÄúComing from Gwangju, you were like my savior. ‚Äú<br>
In his letter, J-Hope thanks Suga for making him feel comfortable when he arrived in Seoul, and for giving him strength when things got hard. He tells Suga how much he appreciates his help and hopes that Suga will always be by his side.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I look at you, I have this thought: ‚ÄòHe is really honest and faithful. He is a good and nice one‚Äù.<br>
In Jimin‚Äôs letter, he tells J-Hope that he probably already knows what he wants to say, because he and J-Hope often talk about their feelings together. Jimin says that he admires J-Hope‚Äôs honest and faithful character and has learned a lot from him.</p>
<li><h3>Before the release of WINGS, Suga and RM cried together as they remembered past hardships.</li>
Backstage, Suga talked about how, as trainees, he and RM had wondered when they would debut. RM said he and Suga used to watch MAMA together. They wondered if they would ever win an award. They‚Äôve come so far!
<li><h3>Every time BTS wins an award, they express their love for their fans and their company, but most importantly‚Ä¶<br>
‚Ä¶for each other.</li>
<li><h3>BTS threw surprise birthday parties, to let each member know how special he is to the rest of the group.</li>
<li><h3>They celebrated each other‚Äôs solo debuts, by visiting the set with moral support‚Ä¶<br>
‚Ä¶and food!</li>
<li><h3>Suga and J-Hope</li>
As we know, next to an introvert, there‚Äôs always an extroverted friend dragging them along into every and any situation. That perfectly describes Suga, the generally quiet and often tired rapper, and J-Hope, the sunshine of the group who is constantly full of energy. Whenever Suga needs to recharge his batteries, J-Hope is his go-to person, which is why their dynamic works so well. In essence, J-Hope tends to push Suga out of his comfort zone, bringing out his most childish side.<br>
J-Hope has also opened up about how much Suga helped him when he became a trainee under BIGHIT, being one of the first people to talk to him and make him relax during that difficult period in his life. In a heartfelt confession, the lead dancer shared his appreciation for his friend, who was always there for him in his toughest moments.
<li><h3>Jin and RM</li>
Although Jin might have a very youthful spirit, he doesn‚Äôt mess around when it comes to standing up for his members. Since RM leads the group, Jin often tries to take some of that responsibility onto his own shoulders, in order to ease his friend. In interviews, we can sometimes spot Jin helping RM when he struggles to get his message across, especially when speaking a foreign language.<br>
In turn, RM has expressed his gratitude for having someone to rely on, and finding comfort in having someone to share his worries with. Because they work so closely together to keep things running smoothly within the group, these two are often referred to as the mom and dad of the band.
<li><h3>Jimin and Jungkook</li>
From their early days as a team, Jimin has manifested a soft spot for the youngest BTS member, constantly looking after him ‚Äî perhaps more than necessary. As for Jungkook, he hasn‚Äôt always appreciated all the fuss, which is normal for a young kid, but he certainly seems to have grown into it over time. Nowadays, he lets Jimin hang off of him as he so pleases, not shying away from the affection as much, and taking on a more caring demeanor.<br>
Jungkook and Jimin are said to be one of the closest pairs in the group currently, often practicing their songs incessantly before a concert, and spending time together off work. The two also have lots of fun at work, using every break to goof around by play-boxing, messing with the other members, and piggybacking each other.
<li><h3>RM and Suga</li>
When you live with someone for more than a decade, you‚Äôre bound to grow close. That‚Äôs the case with Suga and RM, as they frequently make a point to remind us. The two rappers were the first to join BTS, and as a consequence, they have lived together the longest out of all the members, which is quite the feat. We‚Äôve seen marriages fall apart quicker.<br>
Joining the group first also meant that these two struggled the most until their debut, working incessantly together to create music and tiring themselves out practicing while struggling to make ends meet. All for a dream they didn‚Äôt yet know would lead somewhere. Over the years, the two have spoken about that arduous time in their lives, and the many doubts that plagued them, which makes their current success that much more meaningful. The fact that they achieved their goals together is the cherry on top.
<li><h3>Jungkook and RM</li>
It‚Äôs no secret that Jungkook has a place in his heart for RM, the person he looks up to the most. The youngest member has expressed numerous times how much he has always admired the leader of BTS, not only for who he is as a person but for all the hard work he puts into the band, and the responsibility he carries on his shoulders. Leading a group of seven isn‚Äôt always easy, especially when you were a teenage boy reaching a level of fame you weren‚Äôt prepared for.<br>
From the moment he met him, Jungkook recognized RM‚Äôs talent for music and his immense potential, which left a huge impression on the then-13-year-old. During his time in BTS, Jungkook mentioned several times that he joined the band because of RM, turning down numerous other agencies that wanted to recruit him for the extremely poor BIGHIT. Despite all odds, it looks like Jungkook made the right call.
<li><h3>V and Suga</li>
Although they admit to not having that much in common, Suga and V‚Äôs dynamic is one of the most endearing in BTS. For starters, V constantly expresses his massive admiration for Suga‚Äôs musical contributions to the band, considering him the best rapper on the team. Oftentimes, V can be seen jamming to BTS‚Äô more rap-heavy songs and attempting to perform Suga‚Äôs parts in particular.<br>
As for Suga, he seems to have a soft spot for the youngest BTS members, particularly V. Whenever the vocalist asks something of him, Suga simply cannot refuse, and ends up going along with whatever V wants. Suga also has a hard time displaying affection, but as far as V is concerned, he is getting those hugs, no matter how much the rapper pretends to hate it.
<li><h3>Jungkook and V</li>
Being the two youngest, V and Jungkook have always been close, often getting into hijinks together during their first years in BTS. They were quite the pair of troublemakers. As they aged up, the need to wreak havoc decreased, but their friendship remained solid. Time and time again, Jungkook mentioned how V was the person who brought him out of his shell as a teenager, making him the easiest person to talk to.<br>
In 2020, the pair mentioned sadly growing apart for a period of time, as a consequence of growing up and having fewer one-on-one conversations. Fortunately, there‚Äôs nothing a good heart-to-heart can‚Äôt solve, and the relationship between Jungkook and V re-emerged stronger than ever.
<li><h3>RM and J-Hope</li>
Despite being the same age, J-Hope and RM have not always been the closest of friends. There‚Äôs no particular reason for that, and it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt get along; they just didn‚Äôt grow very close during their earliest years together. To the delight of many ARMY, the pair‚Äôs friendship took a turn at some point, and the two are now close friends.<br>
Spending more time together certainly allowed RM and J-Hope‚Äôs bond to grow, but there is still some lingering awkwardness in the way the two interact. While J-Hope has an easy time expressing affection for his teammates, RM is more reserved and doesn‚Äôt always know how to act. This results in some very endearing moments between the pair, with RM trying his best to push through his embarrassment and show affection.
<li><h3>Jin and Jungkook</li>
Despite the five-year age gap between the two, Jin and Jungkook have the funniest dynamic in the group, tending to act very childishly with one another‚Äîin a good way, of course. They‚Äôre often seen play fighting or trying to annoy the other, but make no mistake, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre so close that they feel comfortable doing so. It‚Äôs not all rough-housing, though, they can also be affectionate at times, in their own ways.<br>
Joining BTS and moving into their dorm at the young age of 13, Jungkook had to rely on Jin a lot, since he is the oldest in the group. Every morning until Jungkook finished school, Jin would drive the younger there, and sometimes buy him meals. Because of this, both Jin and the BTS ARMY tend to joke that the oldest member practically raised Jungkook, while the latest likes to tease Jin about his age.
<li><h3>Jimin and V</li>
V and Jimin‚Äôs friendship is undoubtedly the most adored among fans and for good reason. Because they‚Äôre the same age, these two members have always been particularly close, having an openness with each other that one might not share with just anyone. Jimin and V frequented the same high school, shared groups of friends, and learned to rely on one another over the years.<br>
At one point, V even admitted to liking Jimin the most out of all his bandmates‚Äîto their faces, no less‚Äîand surprised absolutely no one. If that‚Äôs not proof enough of their bond, the iconic duet, ‚ÄúFriends,‚Äù gives us an even better understanding of the pair‚Äôs relationship. In the song, Jimin and V reflect on their shared youth, their differences, promise to continue at each other‚Äôs side, and proclaim themselves as soulmates.
<li><h3>Jungkook and J-Hope</li>
 J-Hope and Jungkook have such a pure and loving relationship it‚Äôs hard not smile when seeing these two together. They literally cannot take their eyes (or hands) off of each other. They can‚Äôt help but laugh when looking at each other. Even when they are apart, they find ways to find each other. They always find time to play around regardless of TPO. Just looking at these two brings a sense of purity into our hearts. And once on stage, the duality kicks in and we are able to witness a whole different side to this duo! J-Hope can try to be cute, but Jungkook will always go ‚ÄúHold my mic.‚Äù A healthy battle of aegyo time to time keeps the friendship lively. Their often back hugs, piggy bank rides and once Jungkook has been numerous times caught getting a sniff of his hyung and all he said was "Hobi hyung smells good!"
<li><h3>RM and Jimin</li>
RM mentioned in a November 2018 VLIVE that ‚ÄúJimin needs a lot of love and attention.‚Äù And clearly, he‚Äôs not afraid to ask for it!<br>
Also, Jimin seems to be more outgoing than RM, since he‚Äôs usually the one starting these interactions‚Ä¶ But that doesn‚Äôt mean RM is disengaged at all. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs certainly emotionally enrolled in all of these situations‚Äù. When they renamed themselves‚Äùminimoni". They are literally so cute and so sweet to each other but at the same time so chaotic. Jimin brings out Joons playful silly side, and Joon is someone Jimin can call and talk to about anything that‚Äôs on his mind.
Jimin also loves to tease RM on-stage by pinching his cheeks or tugging on his ear. This ‚Äúgentle intimate touching‚Äù shows that the two are very close and that they have a playful and intimate relationship
<li><h3>Jin and Suga</li>
Jin and Suga have very different personalities, which could cause their relation not to be so easy, but these idols have confessed that it was just that that allowed them to get closer, since they are so different that they manage to complement each other. According to them, the secret of their friendship is that everything happens naturally , they can have long conversations on the subject and it will never become uncomfortable, so they both have great confidence and feel free to show themselves as they are.<br>
But also, Yoongi and Seokjin were roommates for a long time, which allowed them to know more about each other. One of the things they learned during this time was to recognize each other‚Äôs limits , which they have respected in a simple way, making their relationship avoid misunderstandings.
<li><h3>J-Hope and Jimin</li>
The friendship between J-Hope and Jimin is truly underrated and, as part of 3J (with Jungkook), the duo is also in charge of dance in BTS.<br>
BTS are all as close to each other as siblings, which means that sometimes they get jealous of each other. It was recently on show when the members shared their ‚Äújealousy‚Äù regarding the bond between Jimin and J-Hope.Suga revealed that he‚Äôd heard part of Jimin‚Äôs song. Yet, J-Hope went one step further, adding, ‚ÄúI heard all of it.‚Äù Jimin quickly explained that J-Hope had heard a different song to Suga, but it still seemed like the progress of the tracks was more than most expected.RM then seemed to have the perfect answer to why J-Hope heard the songs, but nobody else did. Despite J-Hope‚Äôs protests, RM was sure that Jimin has a favorite when it came to the members of BTS.<br>
<b>Hoseok is always number one to Jimin. You have to understand that. We‚Äôre all second to Hoseok.</b>
‚Äî RM<br>
At a warm-up match between Egypt and the Korean national soccer team that was being held in South Korea. While filming one of the moments, they noticed Jimin and J-Hope a few rows down enjoying the game. In particular, they had the cutest reaction when South Korea scored.
<li><h3>V and Jin</li>
In BTS, V and Jin are often referred to as the "visual line" of the group, due to their striking looks and on-stage presence. They have been seen interacting and performing together on stage, and have been known to share a close bond. After watching a very touching scene from ‚ÄòBurn the Stage‚Äô V and Jin have developed a very meaningful and powerful relationship with each other. They are very sincere and care about each other so much because the have leaned from their fights that they love and care for each other so does every other BTS member. They both have similar interests and hobbies and both love to cuddle something when they sleep. v along with his oldest hyung Jin has a song sang together ‚Äúeven if I die it‚Äôs you‚Äù ost of V starred Hwarang drama. Jin always has a soft corner towards his younger one, expressing their love towards each other and doing fan services where jin doesn‚Äôt do fanservice on stage with other members except for his younger brother. V and Jin have also been seen hanging out together and supporting each other's interests. In interviews, V has mentioned that Jin is like an older brother to him and that he feels comfortable talking to him about anything. Jin has also spoken about his admiration for V's artistic talents and his unique personality.
<li><h3>Jungkook and Suga</li>
When the Bangtan boys went on a trip to Malta as a part of their Bon Voyage series, Suga and Jungkook were paired together Suga took Jungkook to a club for drinks. Suga has a good knowledge of liquors and hence, he was seen teaching Jungkook how to drink a drink. Suga taught Jungkook that their 'friendship is like Irish Bomb'. The two recited it like their friendship motto. A lot of ARMYs call them Lamb Skewers duo/couple as both love the most is Lamb Skewers. During Rookie King when the Bangtan Boys were asked to make some confessions, Suga had confessed to stealing Jungkook's underwear. Suga lets Jungkook pester him, prank him or mimic him. Jungkook dotes on Suga too.
<li><h3>RM and V</li>
 RM originally thought V would be a troublemaker when they first met! While this is what RM originally thought, the two got close rather quickly. RM shared that he and V used to wear weird outfits and walk around outside. The two also rebelled together, such as going out to eat ice cream without telling anyone. During an interview, the members were asked to give their thoughts on the member sitting to the right of them. V was tasked with RM, and he started by praising RM‚Äôs ability to look after the members. If one of the members is having any worries, RM either texts that member personally or he has a face to face talk with them. V concluded by speaking about how the members are always encouraging each other and that this is why their bond is so great! Namjoon have willingly and enthusiastically taken up the role of being an elder brother to Taehyung to protect him from the harsh city life. Namjoon felt really thankful for his younger brother for showing him how to not ponder on the negative thoughts for long. So Namjoon must have felt a comradeship with Taehyung when they were struggling.
<li><h3>Jin and J-Hope</li>
The combination of Jin and J-Hope, known as 2seok! They are all very close to one another. Jin and Hobi energize and hype one another which is a great way to come closer to one another and have fun. The two were being playful and flirty with each other on the instagram posts. Having to complete mandatory military services this duo were the first to join the military. At Incheon Airport as they headed for America, Jin and J-Hope could be seen playing rock, paper, scissors in the background of the shot. It might have been a victory for J-Hope as when the cameras moved back to all the members, Jin was now carrying J-Hope‚Äôs bag. Jin was even more touched when J-Hope brought him his favourite gummy bears on Astronaut music video sets, calling him the ‚Äòepitome of a good friend‚Äô. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to come,‚Äù he said, and J-Hope asked, ‚ÄúShould we do a dance break now?‚Äù
<li><h3>Suga and Jimin</li>
Suga and jimin are like siblings where both will tease each other but are always there whenever other need him . They both fight like kids but are always ready to help other and thats the sweet part of their friendship. Jimin openly tells he cares for suga and loves him like his elder brother but suga being introvert just shows his love and care through small gestures towards jimin. Jimin peacefully describing his journey to Seoul, I came to Seoul without anything, without any friends. Meanwhile Suga : Without anything? Were you naked?

V picked a very specific time as his defining moment. <b>The phrase I said at 28 minutes and 49 seconds in episode 8 of BTS‚Äôs Rookie King.</b> He chose the moment he said to J-Hope, ‚ÄúYou like me, right?‚Äù He must really love J-Hope for this to be his defining moment! A fan once asked V, ‚ÄúIf the members were girls, who would you date?‚Äù V didn‚Äôt hesitate to choose his beloved hyung! V once posted a series of pictures of J-Hope with a heartfelt caption.<br>
<b>You</b><br><b>Only an exclamation can come out</b><br><b>I can understand now why people look at you and go ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶‚Äù</b><br><b>Hoseokie hyung is an ‚ÄúOh‚Äù kind of being to me‚Ä¶</b><br> V once said when he first met J-Hope, he thought he was the visual of BTS.

<a id="bts logo"><h2><font color= #BF40BF>BTS Logo [2013 to till now]</font></h2></a>
<h3>BTS Bulletproof Vest Logo (2013 To 2016)</h3>
BTS‚Äôs original logo debuted with their first album ‚Äò2 Kool for Skool.‚Äô With their group name being Bangtan Sonyeondan (Bulletproof Boy Scouts), they needed a logo that represented their fight for injustice and the firepower of their vocals. Thus, the bulletproof vest logo was born.
<h3>WINGS: The 4 Circles Logo (2016 To 2017)</h3>
In 2016, BTS ushered in a new era with a new logo. The iconic Wings logo, which was comprised of four circles, was also the cover art of their album of the same name. Many fans assumed that the logo was just a random mix of circles and didn‚Äôt mean anything (which was a welcome breather for fans who did a lot of speculation during the HYYH era).<br>
However, the band assured ARMY (their fanbase) that nothing they do was ‚Äònormal.‚Äô They eventually released a photo that showed the member‚Äôs individual logos. The WINGS logo actually represents each member of the band in an abstract form.
<h3>BTS‚Äôs 2nd WINGS Logo (2017)</h3>
Still reveling in the success of the WINGS era, BTS slightly tweaked the original WINGS logo by featuring four blue empty ellipses that overlapped each other and meet in the middle. The WINGS typeface also changed; it has become bolder. They also removed the rounded edges on the letters and added a tagline (based on one of the new songs added to the current album) ‚ÄúYou Never Walk Alone.‚Äù The entire logo was also colored blue.
<h3>Beyond The Scene (2017-NOW)</h3>
In the summer of 2017, BTS finally released a new version of their iconic logo. The new logo includes two trapezoids that look like doors opening. On top of the logo change, the band also changed the meaning of the name (which enforced the design). As mentioned, BTS used to stand for ‚ÄòBulletproof Boy Scouts.‚Äô After the release of the new logo, they changed the meaning to ‚ÄòBeyond the Scene.‚Äô<br>
The new BTS logo is also composed of two parts:
<ul>
<li>The ARMY logo, which is two trapezoids that represent the half-open doors outside</li>
<li>The BTS logo, which is two trapezoids symbolizing the half-open doors inside.</li></ul>
When you combine the two logos, you get a new symbol. By placing the ARMY logo half on top of the BTS logo, you get a shield, which is a symbol of protection. According to fans, the shield (ARMY) is a bulletproof (BTS) one. It also symbolizes how the band and the fans are always there to protect each other ‚Äî something both parties have been doing over the years.
The logo is meant to symbolize the strong bond between BTS and ARMY. After all, the band has also been very outspoken about their mission to protect the youth from prejudice to encourage their fans to follow their dreams.

<h3>Meaning</h3>
2013<br>
ARMY or A.R.M.Y (Hangul: ÏïÑÎØ∏) is BTS's official fandom name. The fandom was officially established on July 9, 2013, which is considered ARMY day. This happened around a month after BTS' official debut on June 12, 2013.
"A.R.M.Y" stands for "Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth" and it carries quite some meaning behind it, given that "Army" is associated with the military, body armor, and how those two things are always together, the fandom name basically means that fans will always be together with BTS.<br>

BTS and A.R.M.Y are almost mirrored images of each other and they have a relationship that is affected by each other. The symbol of A.R.M.Y is expressed as a door on their viewpoint who is waiting & welcoming BTS on the opposite door when BTS opens a new door.
<p>In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, RM revealed that A.R.M.Y was only one of the choices for the fandom name. If A.R.M.Y didn't get selected as the official fandom name, fans might have been called "Bang-wools" or "Bells". RM explained that ‚ÄúBell‚Äù stems from the Korean word ‚Äúbang wool,‚Äù which sounds like their name ‚ÄúBangtan.‚Äù Although he didn‚Äôt name the person, RM shared that the idea was brought up when they were deliberating on the fandom name. J-Hope then mimicked the way they would have greeted their fans, shouting, ‚ÄúHi Bell!‚Äù Hearing that, RM described how it was supposed to play out in concerts. Their fans would bring bells inside the venue, and they would ring their bells to make noise. RM concluded by expressing how relieved he is that the name ‚ÄúBell‚Äù didn‚Äôt push through.</p>
<p>There are no "requirements" needed to join the BTS ARMY. Anyone can call themselves a member of ARMY so long as they enjoy BTS, regardless of whether or not they've purchased every album or watched every video of theirs.
However, there is an official paid fan club that one can opt for to receive extra BTS goodies and discounts. This is called the ARMY Membership, which was previously available on their Daum fancafe. The service is now handled by Weverse, a platform under HYBE Corporation, BTS' parent company. The basic ARMY membership on Weverse is available for around $22, while the ARMY Membership Merch Pack costs around $150. Both membership packs come with several perks, including ticket reservations and raffles, early BTS content, and the chance to attend special events. Merch Box memberships allow you to purchase unique merchandise boxes that are otherwise unavailable to others.</p>

<p>BTS were left in floods of tears on the second night of their sold-out shows at London‚Äôs Wembley Stadium after fans gave them a beautiful surprise. During BTS‚Äòs second day at the Wembley Stadium, 90,000 Armys surprised the members with a passionate rendition of their song ‚ÄúYoung Forever‚Äù tribute towards the end of the show. The members initially stood still, shocked by the event, then soon broke down in tears from the overwhelming emotions. The moment served as a thank you to them for putting on an exceptional string of shows.<br>
It all started when the staff members decided to hold a special event for BTS with the fans. They wanted to create a memorable moment that‚Äôll last a lifetime for both the members and the fans who have worked so hard during their world tour.It all started when the staff members decided to hold a special event for BTS with the fans.

The members each expressed their gratitude and love to the fans who‚Äôve supported them all throughout their world tour. Even as the night continued, they couldn‚Äôt get over the event. And the fans will never forget this moment too!<br>
‚ÄòBTS reaction to Young Forever surprise event,‚Äô one posted. ‚ÄòThe way they were confused for a second and then crumbled. I literally have been crying for a hot minute now..‚Äô<br>
‚ÄòThe staff made army sing the chorus of Young Forever and damn when I tell you the boys burst in tears omg I‚Äôm so emo rn. Especially Jungkook and Jimin, those two couldn‚Äôt even stop and made me cry too (sic),‚Äô another commented.<br>
‚ÄòHow am I supposed to go on the rest of my night after that?! @BTS_twt someone should go live to comfort the rest of ARMY bawling over this so much love I can‚Äôt,‚Äô a fan begged. ‚Äò#BTSatWembley #BTS #foreveryoung.‚Äô<br>
While a Twitter user added: ‚Äò@BTS_twt you deserve the whole world! This is just a small thank you for everything u do for us we will remain #foreveryoung. #BTSatWembley #BTS.‚Äô</p>

Army Bomb (ÏïÑÎØ∏Î∞§) is BTS's official light stick.<br>
<h3>History: Version 1</h3>
About two years after the debut of BTS, Big Hit Entertainment announced the release of the group's fan official lightstick. On March 10, 2015, BTS's official light stick design was unveiled through the group's fan caf√©. Having a translucent, rounded shape, this light stick mimics the pattern of a globe describing how the group has taken over the world with growing international popularity. All members also shared photos of them posing with the lighted light stick.
<h3>Version 2</h3>
On January 2017, a teaser image was revealed of the second version for the Army Bomb. This second version was released on February 10, 2017 and came with Bluetooth to enable color changes during concerts.
<h3>Version 3</h3>
On July 5, 2018, a teaser image was revealed of the third version for the Army Bomb. This version was released on July 27, 2018 and it has an official app to switch the light stick to concert and manual mode using Bluetooth.
<h3>Map of the Soul Special Edition</h3>
This version was released on April 14, 2020 and it has an official app to switch the light stick to concert and manual mode using Bluetooth.

<p>All the members of BTS have different coloured mics. The colour and design represent the individual‚Äôs goals and personality. In the recent album release, we could see that Jin, RM, J-Hope and Jungkook had all changed their mic colours and all the members had new customised mics embedded with Swarovski crystals.
 RM had the blue microphone, Jin chose a pink microphone Just like his nickname 'Pink Prince', Suga used the black one, J-Hope's was silver, Jimin's was gold, V had green, and Jungkook had the purple microphone. However, at the last concert of the tour in October, there was a change  RM has 2 mics Silver & Black with rainbow crystals from his Blue one, Jin's is White with 3 tiny pink butterflies from his Pink one, Suga's remains Black, J-Hope's remains Red, Jimin's is Orange from his Gold one, V's is Green with no crystals and Jungkook's is purple with rainbow crystals. </p>Recently V's mic was changed as there was some technical error with the microphone with green so he switched to another one. It's normal during performance with the artist even Seokjin changed his mic to light green colour as his pink mic was going through problem during Busan concert.

<p>Big Hit Entertainment has officially released TinyTAN characters which have been inspired by the BTS members. These cute character versions of the members express BTS‚Äôs second self and shows them transcending through the ‚ÄòMagic Door‚Äô between reality and their world.<br> TinyTAN doesn‚Äôt just take on the characteristics of the members, but also delivers a positive message and empathy through their music and performance that will be released through various contents.<br>
On August 8, 2020 BTS released a video through their official YouTube channel that showed TinyTAN opening the magic door and cheering up the main character who is tired from the reality of life. The characters are seen dancing to ‚ÄúMIC Drop‚Äù and received praise for its similarity to the actual performance. TinyTAN was first released last October through their ‚ÄúIDOL‚Äù trailer video. These characters were made by Big Hit IP through their R&D studio with around 50 professionals in the animation field. Fans were shocked at just how detailed and synchronized the characters actions were to the actual members. Big Hit plans to introduce TinyTAN in various ways, including figures, merchandise, and other media contents. Weverse Shop also plans to release products with the TinyTAN theme as well as release a sequel to the previously released video sometime later this year.<br>
Big Hit commented, ‚ÄúEach of the BTS members has their own unique characteristics that cannot be compared to any other popular character series. We will release various healing contents filled with the message of hope and empathy through BTS‚Äôs second self, TinyTAN.‚Äù<br>
With their looks, behaviors and good-hearted influence modeled after the septet, the characters were recently featured in an advertisement for the fabric softener product Downy.<br>
They also released a music video called ‚ÄúMagic Door,‚Äù where they sang and danced to ‚ÄúMic Drop‚Äù.</p>

BT21, the brand and its characters were born from a collaborative project between LINE FRIENDS and BTS. Since its launch in October 2017, the brand has captured the hearts and minds of youths worldwide with its charming designs, unique concept and thoughtful storytelling.<br>
Significant effort has been made in communicating with the global fan-base in the making of this concept, which continues to this day. The rapid growth supported by fans has led to the expansion of the brand into the BT21 UNIVERSE.
Online shops and physical stores located worldwide are providing consumers with unique brand experience and quality products, and digital presence in the form of animated content and games are going strong. Collaborations with trendsetting brands have picked up as well with even more partnerships on the horizon, culturing the brand scope into an even more youthful, vibrant outlook.<br>
BT21 is the first project of LINE FRIENDS CREATORS. It is a new IP co-created by LINE FRIENDS and BTS. Rather than simply creating avatars of the physical appearance of artists, BT21 consists of 8 different charming characters created by BTS members, where all of them actively participated in the whole process from drawing sketches to elaboration."<br><br>
