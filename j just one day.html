<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Just One Day (Japanese)</h1>
<p>"하루만" (Just One Day) is a song by BTS. It was released on February 12, 2014, and appears as the fifth track for their second mini album Skool Luv Affair and as the seventh track in the repackage album Skool Luv Affair Special Addition. The music video was released on April 6, 2014. Big Hit Entertainment released one track, "Just One Day," on February 6, 2014 for free pre-streaming ahead of BTS's comeback. They released an MV teaser of the song much later on April 2.<br>
The music video for "Just One Day (하루만)" was then released on April 6 in preparation for the group's follow-up promotions. The music video showed a lighter contrast from "Boy in Luv"; it featured the members sitting in the light and shadows as well as dancing with chairs on a white background. Various version's of the 'Just One Day' MV were released after the original version, such as the choreography version, the facial expressions version, etc.
This song has a Japanese version featured in their second Japanese single "Boy in Luv" and in their first Japanese studio album Wake Up. Both "Boy in Luv" and "Just One Day" music videos were produced and directed by Lumpens and GDW.<br>
The song is about the protagonist wanting to spend just one day with his romantic partner. He talks about how much he likes her and how he wishes they could cuddle and go on adventures together. The chorus repeats his desire to spend just one day with her. The bridge talks about all the things they could do together in that one day if she would just stay with him.</p>

<pre>[Intro: Jung Kook, RM]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah just one day, one night
That's all I ever want girl

[Verse 1: SUGA]
Just one day jikan aru nara
Kimi no amai kaori de gussuri nemuritai
Taito na sukejeeru no ma kikai areba
Yasashii sono hitomi ni utsuritai
I like that sono tsuyayaka na kami
Kami wo ageru sono shigusa ga tamaranaku “kami”
Doko ni ikou ga futari de te wa koshi no atari
Yo! my honey kimochi ga shimaru kimi wo miru tabi
Kakaru BGM kokyuu no sound
Ore wo yobu kimi no koe de chuu wo mau
You na kibun de mou odoritai mou hoka wa kyouminai
Kimi wo sagasu I'm a boukenka so hold me tight
Zutto nagamete itainda girl
Mabushi sugiru kimi dakara
Sou yatte asa made omoi egaita world
Datte mou ore ni wa tooi yume dakara

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Just one day, kimi to futari ireru nara
