<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Danger (Japanese)</h1>
<p>"Danger" is a song by BTS. It was released on August 20, 2014, serves as the title track and and appears as the second track for their first studio album Dark & Wild. A remixed version featuring Vietnamese singer Thanh Bui was released on November 20, 2014. The music video for "Danger" was released on 1theK's YouTube Channel. It featured the group dressed in black performing with sharp choreography in a subway tunnel, and in a warehouse with burning shopping carts. This song has a Japanese version featured in their third Japanese single "Danger" and in their first Japanese studio album WAKE UP and as the third track for their second Japanese compilation album THE BEST OF 防弾少年団 -JAPAN EDITION-. The song also appears as the fifth track on CD1 of their first anthology album Proof. For both "Danger" and "War of Hormone," the band danced to choreography that was created by Son Sungdeuk. One month later, the remixed version of the "Danger" music video, a collaboration with a Vietnamese singer and songwriter Thanh Bùi, was released. The "Danger" music video was produced and directed by Lumpens and GDW.<br>
The MV starts out with the individual members in brooding shots, contemplating over the relationships that seems to be going nowhere. The members all work out their angst in different ways — Jung-kook and J-Hope distracting themselves through artistic means, while Suga and Ji-min sweat it out physically. And V contemplates his haircut.
As the song progresses, the boys still wait in vain for messages or calls from the girl, but to no avail. The bitterness and resentment build up to the point where they lose control — Jung-kook destroys his piano, Jimins breaks his punching bag, Suga throws his basketball out of the window, Rap Monster gives himself a tattoo, V cuts his hair. (A funny episode that happened during the MV filming: V accidentally snipped his own hair while cutting the wig, which might attribute to his shorter bangs during some of the dance scenes.) The dark palette of the MV scream desolation and grunginess, and the styling choices of leather and denim further add to the overall grittiness of the MV. The deserted, beat-up looking practice rooms as well as the abandoned subway station all contribute to the emotions of loneliness and rejection that the boy feels because of being neglected.</p>
