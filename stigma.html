<h1 style= "Algerian">V - STIGMA</h1>
<p>"Stigma" is a solo song by V of BTS. It was released on October 10, 2016, and appears as the fifth track for their second studio album Wings and the repackage album You Never Walk Alone. This song is based on V s character in the HYYH ( BTS universe) where Taehyung’s father is abusive towards him and his sister after their mom died. One day he comes home to find his dad abusing his sister and ends up killing him trying to save her. The song talks about the burden he felt all the time he suffered from his father ,the feelings that he hid from everyone while he was being abused (maybe he tried not show his friends and sister the hardship he is in) and he feels sorry towards his sister,father and friends for different reasons. He now sees himself as a sinner and blames himself for his sister’s pain(because he was not strong enough to protect her only because he couldn’t stand up to his father ) and therefore he wants to erase his sins but he cant do that and now he just asks for forgiveness.<br>
“Singularity,” “Scenery,” “Winter Bear,” “Inner Child.” Every one of BTS V‘s solo songs tells a different story, and “Stigma” might be the most heartbreaking of all. “Stigma” explores the tragic backstory of V’s fictional self in the BTS Universe. His character is arrested after he kills his abusive father to protect himself and his sister, played by actress Seo Eun Ah. Although the “Stigma” storyline is fictional, its raw emotion and anguish couldn’t be more real. In a new interview with Weverse Magazine, V discussed his solo songs, including his first, “Stigma.” V participated in writing the song’s lyrics and chorus. V’s lyrics express the growing pains of youth as well as a sense of frustration many young people experience. “I wanted to portray someone young,” he said. “still growing up, crying out in anguish—that feeling of wanting to thrash about and tell the world you’re tired and fed up.”<br>
“Stigma,” however, is just the first chapter in a story, and that story has a happy ending. V said, “the young person in ‘Stigma’ passed through ‘Singularity’ and ‘Inner Child’ and grew up.”</p>
