<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - No More Dream</h1>
<p>"No More Dream" is a song by BTS released on June 12, 2013 and serves as the title track and appears as the fourth track for their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. The music video for "No More Dream" was released on June 12, 2013 ahead of BTS debut showcase. "No More Dream" dance version was later released on June 16, 2013 in the middle of the group's promotion on music programs. The lyrics of the album "2 Cool 4 Skool" primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future. During the production of the album, Suga and Rap Monster rewrote the lyrics of "No More Dream" more than 20 times.<br>
The album's lead single "No More Dream" also debuted on the Week 25 issues of Gaon's Digital and Download charts at numbers 124 and 84 respectively, with 23,237 sales. In the US, it debuted at number 14 on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart issue dated June 29, 2013, and spent three consecutive weeks on the ranking. In 2020, the single also reentered the chart, on the issue dated April 11, at a new peak of number two, with an additional 1,000 copies sold— its best single sales week on the ranking—and became the best-selling K-pop song in the US that week. According to Billboard, "No More Dream" had sold a total of 45,000 copies in the country up to that point.
This song has a Japanese version featured in their first Japanese single "NO MORE DREAM", their first Japanese studio album WAKE UP and their second Japanese compilation album "THE BEST OF 防弾少年団 -JAPAN EDITION-".<br>
The song also appears as the second track on CD1 of their first anthology album Proof.<br>
‘No More Dream’ is the quintessential song about the need to break out of society’s restrictions. More specifically, it calls for a sense of rebelliousness in today’s youth. This is especially true if one wishes to achieve their dreams. The lyrics speak of big houses, cars, and rings. School and boring public jobs are ridiculed. BTS are resisting the imposition of other people’s dreams on them. Doing what you love seems to be the key message here.<br>
The actual music video begins with the various BTS members recklessly parking a bus. They are dressed as young punks who are interested in having a good time. This transitions into the core song and dance sequence. Youngsters can be seen skateboarding, bicycle freestyling, and dancing against the backdrop of different urban environments. These are interspersed with shots of a school and residential neighborhood. These scenes are used deliberately. They allude to BTS’ desire to challenge existing norms and expectations.</p>
