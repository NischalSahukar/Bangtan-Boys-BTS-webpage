<h1 style= "Algerian">BTS - Friends</h1>
<p>“Friends” is a tribute to the friendship between BTS members Jimin and V. The main music video features clips of them practicing for performances, touring, and hanging out with each other backstage. It offers a rare glimpse into their camaraderie with each other. The compilation also includes snippets of them going about their lives with the other members.<br>
“Friends” is a heartwarming demonstration of two good pals. It is also meant to show fans the strength of their bonds and relationship with the rest of the crew. Without a shred of doubt, this tune is another arrow in their quiver of creativity. It certainly bolsters their credibility as a boyband that appeals to people around the world.<br>
It is the fifteenth track from their fourth studio album Map of the Soul:7. The aforementioned album, as of 2020, is the best-selling album in South Korea of all time with more than 4 million copies having been sold.
During an interview, Jimin revealed that he had become more patient with V. This allowed him to understand the latter and accommodate him more. “Friends” is therefore an encapsulation of their growth over the course of the past 7 years. These sentiments certainly give the song its tear-jerking factor.<br>
'Friends' becomes the first BTS subunit song produced by a BTS member to achieve a Gold RIAJ Certification<br>
'Friends,' a song produced, written, and composed by Jimin and a subunit with member Taehyung, was originally released as a part of BTS' Map of the Soul 7 album in February 2020. The song, which beautifully illustrates the friendship between the two, was an instant hit with fans and the public alike.<br>
'Friends' became the first Korean song to be an OST for a global Hollywood Blockbuster film Marvel's 'Eternals' after its Director, Chloé Zhao, expressed her love for Jimin and the song. Thanks to the song, Jimin was the First and Only BTS member to have a song he produced nominated for the 10th Gaon Chart Awards for Song of The Year.</p>
